```python
# Primary: Claude Sonnet 4 for complex reasoning
# Fallback: GPT-4 for broad compatibility  
# Specialized: Industry-specific fine-tuned models

class SwitchingCostOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, industry_config, competitor_profile):
        self.ai_engine = self.select_optimal_model(industry_config)
        self.industry_framework = self.load_industry_templates(industry_config)
        self.competitive_intelligence = CompetitiveAnalyzer(competitor_profile)
        
    def generate_switching_strategy(self, account_profile):
